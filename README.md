## 🎯 Usage

### Right-Click Menu Options

When you right-click on any track artwork, you'll see:

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Detection** - The script detects when you right-click on SoundCloud artwork
2. **Menu** - Shows custom options: "Save Image" and "Save Track"
3. **Artwork** - Fetches high-resolution artwork (500x500) and downloads it
4. **Tracks** - Uses SoundCloud's API to fetch and download MP3 files
5. **Naming** - Automatically names files based on track/artist information

## 📋 Supported Locations

The script works on artwork found in:

- ✅ Main player (bottom bar)
- ✅ Track pages
- ✅ User/Artist pages
- ✅ Playlist pages
- ✅ Search results
- ✅ Stream/Feed
- ✅ Charts and trending pages

## ⚙️ Configuration

The script works out of the box, but you can modify these settings in the code:

- **Image Quality**: Default is 500x500 (highest available)
- **Image Format**: Saves as `.jpg`
- **Audio Format**: Downloads as `.mp3`
- **Naming Convention**: 
  - Artwork: `track_title.jpg`
  - Tracks: `artist_name - track_title.mp3`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>Menu doesn't appear when right-clicking</b></summary>

- Make sure Tampermonkey is enabled
- Check that the script is active (should have a green dot in Tampermonkey)
- Refresh the SoundCloud page
- Make sure you're clicking directly on the artwork image
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Download fails or shows error</b></summary>

- Check your browser's download settings
- Make sure you have permission to save files
- Try disabling other extensions that might interfere
- Check browser console for specific error messages
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Wrong image quality or size</b></summary>

- The script automatically fetches the 500x500 version
- If the track only has lower quality artwork, that's what will be saved
- Original upload quality varies by artist/track
